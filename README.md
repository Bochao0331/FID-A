# FID-A
Toolbox for simulation and processing of in-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy data

Getting Started:
1. EITHER a) Go to https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A and click on the "Download ZIP" button to download the package;
   OR     b) open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you would like to store the FID-A repository, and type "git clone https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A.git"
   
2. If you chose option a) above, move the resulting folder "FID-A-master/" into the directory of your choice (e.g. /Users/JohnDoe/Documents/MatlabScripts/, or something like that).

3. Open MATLAB and add the "FID-A-master" (from option a above) or "FID-A" (from option b above) directory to your path using: addpath(genpath(**FULL PATH TO YOUR FID-A-MASTER (OR FID-A) DIRECTORY**));

4. Now you are ready to start using the toolbox!
